# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React.js. Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player wins by placing three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) or when the board is full (a tie).

## Features:

- **Two-player mode**: Play with another person locally.
- **Dynamic grid**: The 3x3 grid updates as players take their turns.
- **Winner detection**: The game automatically detects a winner or a draw.
- **Game reset**: A button to reset the game and start a new round.

## Technologies Used:

- **React.js** for the user interface and game logic.
- **CSS** for basic styling of the board and game elements.
